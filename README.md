# Predicting price of newly constructed apartments in Ile-de-france
This project is a part of a Hackathon at CentraleSupelec
# Project description
Predicting house & apartment price is essential for the real-estate companies to remain profitable & competitive. Within the scope of this project, the client wants a robust model that can predict the price of newly constructed apartments in Ile-de-france. The records of mutations (ownership transfer) from 2014 to 2020 are provided by the client. Additional info such as the apartment geolocation, demographic & geographic info of the region are also used. Among the models tried (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting & Extreme Gradient Boosting), Random forest got the best result on the final test set i.e. 85%.
